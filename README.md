# Euler-Lagrange-Path-Optimization
This project visualizes the concept of action minimization in physics, specifically related to the Euler-Lagrange equation. The script generates multiple random trajectories that do not satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation and highlights the optimal path that minimizes the action.
